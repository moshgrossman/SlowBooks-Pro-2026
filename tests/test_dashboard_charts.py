Covers the monthly_revenue fix: previously summed Invoice.total, which
made non-invoice income (W-2 deposits, paychecks, journal-entered
consulting income) invisible on the dashboard. New behavior sums
transaction_lines.credit against any account whose account_type is
INCOME, so the general ledger is the source of truth.
