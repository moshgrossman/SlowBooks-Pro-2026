# Installation Guide

Ways to run Slowbooks Pro 2026.

---

## Option 0: Windows installer

**Recommended for Windows users.** No Docker, no WSL2, no command line —
Slowbooks Pro runs as a normal desktop app in its own window (no browser
tab). The installer is digitally signed, so Windows shows a verified
publisher instead of a SmartScreen warning.

### Steps

1. Download **`SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest)
   (or from [slowbookspro.com](https://www.slowbookspro.com)).
2. Double-click it and follow the wizard. Everything installs into
   `Program Files`; a Start Menu entry (and optional Desktop shortcut) is
   created.
3. Launch **SlowBooks Pro 2026** — you'll be asked to create your first
   company, and the app opens in its own window.

The app is fully self-contained — **no Docker, no WSL2, no database server,
no Python install**. Your books are stored in ordinary files on your own
machine, under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro`, which upgrades and even
uninstalls leave untouched.

When a new version is released, the footer of the app shows an
**Update available** notice — download the new installer and run it over
the old install; your companies and settings are kept.

### Working with multiple companies

This install manages companies the way QuickBooks Desktop does: each company
is its own file, stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro\data\companies\`.
Every time you open SlowBooks Pro you're asked which company to open (or to
create a new one). To switch companies, close the app and open it again.

### Stopping the app

Just close the window — the server shuts down with it. If something ever gets
stuck, end the **SlowBooksPro** process from Task Manager.

### Troubleshooting

The app runs with no console window — quietly in the background like any
other desktop app. If something goes wrong before the app window can open, a
small popup explains it, and full details are written to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro\data\launcher.log`.

### Backups

Backups created from the Settings UI are simply snapshots of the open
company's `.db` file (stored in the app's `backups` folder). You can also copy
the company files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro\data\companies\` anywhere
you like while the app is closed — each file is a complete, self-contained
company.

### Tradeoffs versus Option 1 (Docker + PostgreSQL)

This path is **single-user, single-machine**: no multi-user client portal
serving other people, no concurrent access. In exchange, there's nothing to
administer — no `pg_dump`, no containers, no background services.

---

## Option 0A: macOS desktop app

**Recommended for Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 14 or newer.** No Docker,
Python, or database server is required.

1. Download `SlowBooksPro-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest).
2. Open the disk image and drag **SlowBooks Pro** to Applications.
3. Eject the image, then launch **SlowBooks Pro** from Applications.

The app is signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple. Each
company is an ordinary SQLite file under
`~/Library/Application Support/SlowBooksPro/data/companies/`. Settings,
backups, uploads, and `launcher.log` live under the same `data` directory and
remain outside the app bundle during upgrades.

This path has the same single-user tradeoffs as the Windows desktop app. Intel
Macs should use Docker or the developer-oriented native install below until a
separately tested Intel build is available.

## Option 0B: Portable — run it off a USB stick

Same app as Option 0, but nothing is installed and nothing is left behind on
the computer you plug into. Your books live on the stick and travel with it.
Useful for working across a few machines, or on a PC where you are not
allowed to install software.

### Steps

1. Download **`SlowBooksPro-windows-x64.zip`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/latest)
   (the `.zip`, **not** the `Setup` `.exe`).
2. Extract the whole folder onto the USB stick.
3. Inside that folder — right next to `SlowBooksPro.exe` — create a new
   folder named exactly **`Data`**.
4. Double-click `SlowBooksPro.exe`.

That `Data` folder is the entire switch. When it is there, every company
file, your settings, uploads and backups are written inside it on the stick.
When it is not there, the app behaves exactly as an installed copy does and
stores everything under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro` on the host machine.

To move to another computer, close the app, eject the stick, plug it in
elsewhere and run `SlowBooksPro.exe` again — your companies are all there.

### What still has to be on the host PC

Only the **Microsoft WebView2 runtime**, which draws the app window. It ships
with current Windows 10 and Windows 11, so on most machines there is nothing
to do. On an older PC that lacks it you would need to install it once, which
does require permission to install software.

PDF printing needs nothing extra — the graphics libraries are bundled inside
the folder on the stick.

### If the stick is write-protected

The app falls back to storing data on the host computer rather than refusing
to start. Everything works, but your books stay on that machine instead of
travelling — so check the stick's write-protect switch if a company you
created seems to have vanished on the next PC.

### Please read this before putting real books on a stick

**A lost stick is a data breach.** The company files and the key that
encrypts employee bank details sit side by side in the `Data` folder, so
whoever picks up the stick can read everything on it — payroll, customers,
bank transactions.

If the books contain other people's personal or payroll information, use a
hardware-encrypted USB stick, or turn on BitLocker To Go for the drive
(Windows: right-click the drive → **Turn on BitLocker**). Treat the stick
like the paper file it replaces.

## Option 1: Docker (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Recommended for Linux servers and Intel Macs.** One command, no
dependency headaches. Note: multi-user over the LAN does **not** require
Docker — Server Edition runs from the signed Windows installer (see
[docs/server-edition.md](docs/server-edition.md)).

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine + Docker Compose (Linux)

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
cp .env.example .env

# Set a strong encryption secret for employee bank PII. The app refuses to
# start against Postgres with the shipped dev default, so this is required:
#   Linux/macOS:  openssl rand -base64 32
#   any OS:       python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
# Put the result on the PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET= line in .env.

docker compose up
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** in your browser.

> On Windows, **Option 0** avoids all of this (no Docker at all, secret
> generated for you, opens a desktop window) — prefer it unless you
> specifically want a multi-user Docker + PostgreSQL server.

### What happens on first run

1. PostgreSQL 17 starts and creates the `bookkeeper` database
2. Alembic runs all migrations (creates 55 tables)
3. Chart of Accounts is seeded (50 accounts — Contractor template, includes the payroll-liability accounts needed for pay-run processing)
4. Uvicorn starts serving the app on port 3001
5. On first visit, you'll be prompted to set an operator password (min 8 characters)

### Loading demo data

To populate the IRS Publication 583 mock data (Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop):

```bash
docker compose exec slowbooks python scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py
```

### Stopping and restarting

```bash
docker compose down          # stop (data persists in volumes)
docker compose up            # restart
docker compose down -v       # stop AND delete all data
```

### Changing the port

Edit `.env`:
```
APP_PORT=8080
```
Then `docker compose up` — the app will be at http://localhost:8080.

### Allowing a different browser origin

CORS defaults to `http://localhost:APP_PORT` and `http://127.0.0.1:APP_PORT`.
If the UI is served from a different host (reverse proxy, LAN IP, etc.), set
`CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` in `.env` to a comma-separated allowlist:

```
CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://books.example.com,https://admin.example.com
```

### Backups

Backups created from the Settings UI are stored in a Docker volume. To copy them out:

```bash
docker compose cp slowbooks:/app/backups ./my-backups
```

## Option 2: Native Install (Linux)

**Best for Linux development.** Direct install, no containers.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 (CI gates against 3.13; 3.12 is verified working)
- PostgreSQL 17 (Docker image ships 17-alpine; older 16 still works for native installs)
- System libraries for WeasyPrint

### Steps

```bash
# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian/Pop!_OS)
sudo apt install -y postgresql python3-venv libcairo2-dev libpango-1.0-0 \
    libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0 libffi-dev

# Create database
sudo -u postgres createuser bookkeeper -P    # password: bookkeeper
sudo -u postgres createdb bookkeeper -O bookkeeper

# Clone
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026

# Create a virtual environment and install into it.
# This is REQUIRED, not optional: Ubuntu 23.04+, Debian 12+, Pop!_OS 24.04
# and Fedora 38+ implement PEP 668, so a bare `pip install` into the system
# interpreter fails with "error: externally-managed-environment".
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if your database credentials differ.
#
# For a local development install, also set:
#     APP_DEBUG=true
# Leaving APP_DEBUG=false (the production default) turns on FORCE_HTTPS,
# which 307-redirects http://localhost:3001 to https://localhost:3001 —
# and a native install serves no TLS on that port, so the browser gets a
# connection error. Production deployments should keep APP_DEBUG=false and
# terminate TLS at a reverse proxy in front of the app.

# Run migrations and seed
alembic upgrade head
python scripts/seed_database.py

# Start the server
python run.py
```

Open **http://localhost:3001**.

> Every command above assumes the virtualenv is active (`source .venv/bin/activate`).
> Without activating it, use the explicit paths instead: `.venv/bin/alembic`,
> `.venv/bin/python`.

### Optional: Load demo data

```bash
python scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py
```

---

## Option 3: Native Install (macOS)

Same as Linux but using Homebrew for system dependencies.

### Steps

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install postgresql@17 cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi

# Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql@17

# Create database
createuser bookkeeper -P    # password: bookkeeper
createdb bookkeeper -O bookkeeper

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up and run
cp .env.example .env
alembic upgrade head
python scripts/seed_database.py
python run.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### WeasyPrint fails with "cannot load library" (macOS/Linux native)

WeasyPrint needs Cairo and Pango. Install them:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libcairo2-dev libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0

# macOS
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf
```

If using Docker, this is handled automatically.

### Port 3001 already in use

Change the port in `.env`:
```
APP_PORT=3002
```

### Database connection refused

- **Docker:** Make sure `docker compose up` is running and postgres is healthy: `docker compose ps`
- **Native:** Make sure PostgreSQL is running: `sudo systemctl status postgresql`

### "pg_dump not found" when creating backups

- **Docker:** This is included in the container automatically.
- **Native Linux:** `sudo apt install postgresql-client`
- **Native macOS:** `brew install postgresql@17`
