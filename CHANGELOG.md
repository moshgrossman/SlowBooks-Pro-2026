# Changelog

Notable changes between releases. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The internal build order
used during development is captured here so the README can stay focused
on what the software does, not on what sprint shipped what.

## [Unreleased]

### Red-team pass on WC3D's Jinja2 XSS fix
WC3D's commit `ca6182f` enabled `autoescape=True` on the two Jinja2
Environments he found (`app/routes/public.py`,
`app/services/pdf_service.py`). A red-team sweep of every other
Jinja2 construction in `app/` turned up **one more spot** missing
the same fix:

- `app/services/email_service.py:139` — `SandboxedEnvironment()`
  (used to render admin-editable email templates with customer-
  supplied data injected as context). Fixed:
  `SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)`.

- Same file, line 156–164 — when the file-based template fails, the
  fallback path was f-string-interpolating `invoice.customer.name`
  directly into an HTML body. Routed through `html.escape()` now.

Added `tests/test_jinja_autoescape_audit.py` — walks every
`Environment(...)` / `SandboxedEnvironment(...)` call in `app/`
(with a proper balanced-paren walker, since `Environment(loader=
FileSystemLoader(...))` defeats a naive `[^)]*` regex) and fails CI
if any one is missing `autoescape=`. The rule can't drift back.

Also verified the JS side: `toast()` uses `textContent`, so all
`toast(\`...${user.name}...\`)` calls are safe by construction;
`openModal()` uses `textContent` for the title (safe) and
`innerHTML` for the body (relies on per-call `escapeHtml()`, which
36 of 40 JS files use — the remainder don't render user-strings).
The broader JS-innerHTML-XSS class is a separate concern already
tracked under the CSP-unsafe-inline-cleanup item in `docs/todo.md`.

### Layout: `alembic/` → `migrations/`
Database migration scripts moved from `alembic/` to the more
conventional `migrations/` at the top level. `script_location` in
`alembic.ini` updated; references in CONTRIBUTING, PR template, and
docs all retargeted. The `alembic` CLI command itself is unchanged
(reads alembic.ini for its script_location), so `alembic upgrade
head` in `docker-entrypoint.sh` keeps working. Git tracked the moves
as renames, so blame history is preserved.

### Schema-wide date-collision fix (the rest of jake-378's pattern)
jake-378 previously fixed the `date: date` field-name-shadows-type
collision in `app/schemas/invoices.py` and `estimates.py` (commits
48cdb79, e12bbb1). A quick reproducer confirmed **pydantic 2.13 still
has the same bug**:

```python
class Update(BaseModel):
    date: Optional[date] = None   # Optional[<the field>] not Optional[date]
                                   # -> "Input should be None" on every value
```

Same pattern existed in **9 more schemas** (banking, bills, cc_charges,
credit_memos, deposits, journal, payments, purchase_orders,
time_entries) — applied jake's `from datetime import date as dt_date`
rename uniformly across all of them. Added
`tests/test_schemas_audit.py` to lock in the rule so the bug can't
drift back in via a new schema file. (296 tests now passing, up from
295.)

### PostgreSQL version doc alignment
Compose files (both dev and prod) already ship `postgres:17-alpine`,
but `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `docs/development.md`, and
`docs/operations.md` all said "PostgreSQL 16" or `brew install
postgresql@16`. Same lag-vs-reality pattern as the Python version
fix. Docs now match what's actually deployed (17).

### Dependency upgrade pass
Five hard-pinned (`==`) deps in `requirements.txt` were months behind.
Pins relaxed to floor-and-cap ranges so future patch/minor bumps land
without needing a release. All upgrades are stable 2.x → 2.x or
patch-only; no API churn expected. pip-audit on the new requirements
remains clean (zero known CVEs).

| Dep | Was | Now | Installed (verified) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alembic` | `==1.13.3` | `>=1.16.0,<2.0` | 1.18.4 |
| `sqlalchemy` | `==2.0.35` | `>=2.0.40,<3.0` | 2.0.49 |
| `pydantic` | `==2.9.2` | `>=2.11.0,<3.0` | 2.13.4 |
| `pydantic-settings` | `==2.5.2` | `>=2.10.0,<3.0` | 2.14.1 |
| `uvicorn[standard]` | `==0.30.6` | `>=0.32.0,<1.0` | 0.47.0 |

Tests: 295 passing on the upgraded set (no source changes needed).

### Python version doc alignment
`README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and `docs/development.md` all said "Python
3.12" or "3.12+", but the Dockerfile, every CI job, and the CVE
comments in `requirements.txt` reference Python 3.13. Docs now say
3.13 (the actual tested version); INSTALL.md notes that 3.12 may work
but isn't gated by CI.

### CRM-side UX additions
- **Customer Details modal** — clicking a customer row now opens a
  single-screen popout (no sub-tabs) with billing/shipping addresses,
  autosaving notes, attached reseller permits, recent invoices, and
  recent payments. Closes the "where do we put notes for everyone to
  see?" gap.
- **Reseller permits module** — new `#/reseller-permits` page with
  expiring-soon strip, per-state format validation (WA 9-digit, CA
  9-12, TX 11), copy-permit/business-name/tax-ID buttons, and a
  unified Verify workflow that opens the state's official lookup site
  in the default browser (`window.open('_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer')`
  after a confirm dialog) then stamps `last_verified_at` / disables
  with an inactive marker. Backend has CRUD + `/expiring` +
  `/validate-format` + `/mark-verified`. Pure record-keeping — there
  is no fake "API call" to the state; the operator does the lookup,
  we record the verification trail.
- **Admin Sign Out button** — topbar now has a dedicated logout button
  that POSTs `/api/auth/logout` and reloads to the splash page. The
  endpoint was live; only the button was missing.

### Test infrastructure
- **Bidirectional wiring audit** — `tests/test_wiring.py` already
  asserted every JS `API.*` call resolves to a route; it now also
  asserts every backend `/api/*` route has a JS caller (or is on the
  `_INTENTIONAL_BACKEND_ONLY` allowlist). The catch-all collector
  picks up template-literal paths (including paths assigned to a
  variable before `API.post(url, …)`), `href=`/`action=` attributes
  in JS-rendered HTML, and `window.open('/api/…')`. Pre-substitutes
  `${…}` blocks before regex matching so nested `encodeURIComponent`
  expressions don't break the path capture. Each allowlist entry now
  carries a comment explaining *why* the route has no SPA caller
  (admin-only, scheduled job, drill-down endpoint shadowed by the
  bundled `/dashboard` response, future UI tab, etc.).
- **Audit hook coverage in tests** — `conftest.py` was creating a
  fresh per-test session factory but never re-attaching the
  `after_flush` audit hook to it, so the entire audit-log mechanism
  was silently bypassed in every existing test. The fixture now calls
  `register_audit_hooks` on the per-test session factory. A new
  matrix test (`test_audit_log_covers_new_entities_but_skips_audit_tables`)
  asserts a ResellerPermit insert lands in `audit_log` and a
  PortalAccess insert does NOT (it's already an audit-flavored table).
- **`_SKIP_TABLES` curated** — `audit_log` was the only entry; added
  `portal_accesses`, `login_attempts`, `document_audits`, and
  `email_log` (every one is itself an audit/log table, and double-
  logging into `audit_log` would just add noise and create a future
  recursion footgun if any of them ever gains a trigger-set `id`).

### Payroll / HR UI additions
- **Portal-token admin view** — Employee Details > Portal Access now
  shows expires-at (red when <30 days), last-used-at, and a
  collapsible recent-access log pulled from `portal_accesses`.
- **PTO accrual editor** — `#/hr/pto` gained an Employee Accruals
  section with enroll-employee-in-policy form and per-row "Run Accrual"
  prompt. Closes the gap where admins had to enroll employees via curl.
- **E-Verify case tracking** — schema additions (`everify_status`,
  `everify_submitted_at`, `everify_closed_at`, `everify_notes`),
  GET/PUT `/api/employees/{id}/everify` endpoints, and a new section
  in the Employee Details modal with color-coded status. Pure
  record-keeping — the federal E-Verify submission still happens via
  the official portal or a vendor; this stores the case so DHS
  inspections find it in one place.

### Partial CSP tightening
- index.html's 11 inline `onclick=`/`oninput=` handlers moved to a new
  `app/static/js/bootstrap.js` that wires them via `addEventListener`
  after DOMContentLoaded. The static shell page now has zero inline
  handlers — would work under a stricter CSP today.
- `'unsafe-inline'` stays in `script-src` and `style-src` because the
  JS-rendered modal templates across the rest of the app still emit
  inline handlers + styles. Removing those is a multi-file refactor
  documented in `docs/todo.md`. Honest accounting added to
  `docs/security-hardening.md`.

### Polish
- `docs/release-checklist.md` section 4 (TLS) now mentions optionally
  submitting the domain to the HSTS preload list once TLS is locked in.

### Audit + ops automation
- **Portal access audit log** — new `portal_accesses` table records
  every authenticated and unauthenticated portal hit (employee_id, IP,
  truncated UA, path, success). Mirrors `LoginAttempt` and gives
  forensic queries something more granular than `portal_token_last_used`.
- **Encryption key rewrap CLI** — `python -m app.services.encryption
  rewrap` re-encrypts every bank-PII blob under the current key, so
  rotation can actually complete (transparent reads via PREV fallback
  was already shipped). Supports `--dry-run`.
- **Wiring audit as a unit test** — `tests/test_wiring.py` grep-and-
  resolves every JS `API.*` call against the registered FastAPI routes.
  Catches typos and stale paths automatically — CI fails when a JS
  caller goes nowhere.
- **End-to-end portal test** — single test walks the entire portal
  lifecycle (mint → claim → 5 cookieless pages → POST PTO → logout →
  cold-401 → force-expire → rotate → claim again).
- **Weekly `pip-audit` GitHub Action** — Sunday cron, opens a
  security-labeled issue on findings (de-duped), fails the workflow run.

### Frontend polish
- **Drag-and-drop document uploads** on Employee Details > Documents.
- **Portal logout button** in `portal/base.html` nav.
- **Branded portal favicon** — `/portal/favicon.ico` serves the
  employer's company logo so each customer's portal carries their own
  bookmark icon.

### Bug fix
- Pay-stub PDF was rendering accountable-plan reimbursements as
  positive line items in the **Deductions** table. Now they have their
  own **Additions to Net (non-taxable)** table above net pay. Net-pay
  math was always right; the display was confusing.

### Tax forms — PDFs, audit hashes, the works
- **WeasyPrint PDF endpoints** — `POST /api/payroll/forms/{w2,w3,940,941}/.../pdf`
  render real printable forms (Acme Co. branded, masked SSN, full box
  data). The existing JSON endpoints stay for future e-file integration.
- **Document audit hashes** — every tax-form PDF carries a SHA-256
  content hash and an audit ID in the footer. Backed by a new
  `document_audits` table with three lookup endpoints
  (`/api/document-audits`, `.../verify/{hash}`, etc.). An auditor with
  the PDF can recompute the hash and confirm authenticity against
  the trust-anchor row.

### Payroll / HR
- **Time-entry → pay-run auto-population** — the pay-run form now has
  a "Use approved time entries" checkbox + live-preview column showing
  unpaid approved hours per employee. Backend was already wired; only
  the frontend opt-in was missing.
- **PTO year-end carryover automation** — new
  `POST /api/pto/accruals/year-end-carryover?target_year=YYYY` endpoint
  caps every accrual at its policy `max_carryover` and resets YTD
  counters, returning a per-row before/after summary.
- **Portal cookie session** — after the first `/portal/{token}` claim,
  the token moves into a `HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict` cookie and
  every subsequent URL is cookieless. No more Referer leak, browser
  history, or shared-bookmark exposure. Backward-compat: emailed
  `/portal/{token}` links still work — they just redirect through the
  claim flow once.
- **Portal branding** — every page renders the employer's company name
  and logo in the header (was generic "Employee Portal").
- **State new-hire report PDF branding** — same treatment.

### Authentication / session hardening
- **Login attempt audit log** — new `login_attempts` table records
  every success and failure (IP, UA, timestamp). Catches the slow
  brute-force attacker who paces under the 5/min rate limit.
- **Session rotation on login** — `request.session.clear()` before
  issuing the auth flag, defense-in-depth against session fixation.
- **Idle session timeout** — sliding window via
  `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 14400s = 4 hours). Sessions
  past the threshold get 401'd and cleared.

### Security
- **App-level `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware`** + HSTS (2-year, includeSubDomains,
  preload) when `FORCE_HTTPS=true`. Session cookie carries `Secure` flag
  in the same conditional.
- **Content-Security-Policy** — `frame-ancestors none`, `object-src
  none`, `form-action self`, Stripe origins allowlisted.
- **Startup fail-hard checks** (production only): refuses to start if
  `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is the dev default, `DATABASE_URL` lacks
  `sslmode`, or `FORCE_HTTPS=false`.
- **Portal token expiry** — 1-year hard + 90-day sliding idle. Expired
  tokens return `410 Gone`.
- **Portal headers** — `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and
  `Cache-Control: no-store` on every portal response.
- **Encryption key versioning** — bank PII ciphertext now prefixed with
  `v1:`. `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_PREV` env var supports
  zero-downtime key rotation; decrypt tries current key first, then
  previous.
- **Per-endpoint rate limiting** — portal at 30/min GET / 10/min POST,
  joining the existing 5/min on login.

### Dependency CVE pass
Bumped requirements.txt to close known CVEs surfaced by `pip-audit`:
- `cryptography` — cap raised from `<44.0` to `<47.0`, floor `46.0.5`
  (closes PYSEC-2026-35, CVE-2024-12797, CVE-2026-26007, etc.)
- `fastapi` — bumped from `0.115.0` to `>=0.121.0,<0.122` to allow
  starlette `0.47+`
- New explicit `starlette>=0.47.2,<0.50` pin (closes CVE-2024-47874,
  CVE-2025-54121)
- New explicit `pyjwt>=2.10.0,<3.0` pin (override intuit-oauth's
  transitive 2.7.0 with known CVE)

`pip-audit -r requirements.txt` now reports **zero known
vulnerabilities**.

### Wiring fixes
Spider-web audit of every `API.*` call against every `@router.*`
handler caught four real breakages:
- 3× `API.delete()` typos (`API.del` is the actual export) — `employees.js`,
  `deductions.js`
- Missing `GET /api/pto/policies/{id}` and `PUT /api/pto/policies/{id}` —
  the policy-edit form was 404'ing
- `/approve` and `/reject` alias routes for the PTO `/decision` endpoint —
  the buttons were hitting non-existent paths

### Docs + repo conventions
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**, **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**,
  **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,config}.{md,yml}`** — the
  standard set this size of repo should have had.
- **`docs/hipaa-compliance.md`** — Security Rule mapping, 8-gap honest
  assessment, deployment recommendations.
- **`docs/security-hardening.md`** + **`docs/wiring-audit.md`** + **`docs/todo.md`** — engineering
  logs for the hardening pass, the wiring audit methodology, and the
  internal TODO scratchpad.
- README de-Phased / de-Tiered — that history now lives in this
  CHANGELOG file instead of cluttering the user-facing readme.

### Cleanup
- **Alembic revision collision fixed** — tier1 was sharing
  `f6a7b8c9d0e1` with the Phase 11 inventory migration. Renamed to
  `f7a8b9c0d1e2`; chain is now linear.
- `test_frontend_pages.py` moved from repo root to
  `scripts/integration_test_frontend.py` (it's a live-HTTP integration
  script, not a unit test).
- `app/templates/invoice_pdf_v2.html` deleted — added 5 weeks ago but
  never wired into `pdf_service.py`.
- `backups/` directory kept tracked (via `.gitkeep`) but contents
  gitignored so dumps don't accidentally land in commits.

### Test coverage
296 tests passing. Up from 119 at the start of this branch's work.
All previously-passing tests still pass.

### Docs reorganization
Root now keeps only `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the conventional set). Everything
else moved into `docs/`.

## [2.0.0] — May 2026

### Added
- **Analytics dashboard** at `#/analytics` — KPI cards plus four charts
  (12-month revenue line, expenses doughnut, A/R+A/P stacked bar,
  90-day cash forecast), MTD/QTD/YTD period selector, CSV/PDF export
  with branded headers.
- **AI Insights** — Optional one-shot executive brief (3 observations /
  3 risks / 3 recommendations) with seven supported providers (xAI Grok,
  Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI, Cloudflare self-hosted gateway, Anthropic
  Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini). Bring-your-own-key, encrypted at rest.
- **AI Predefined Analyses** — 11 curated actions across 5 categories,
  replacing the earlier free-form chat (more reliable across providers).
- **Inventory ledger** — Perpetual inventory with weighted-average cost,
  automatic COGS journal entries on every sale, reorder points,
  Adjust modal for add/remove/set-to-count.
- **Drill-down reports** — P&L and Balance Sheet rows are click-through
  to source transactions with running balance and source-doc links.
- **Saved Reports** — Name and one-click rerun favorite report configs.
- **Duplicate detection** — Fuzzy matching on customer/vendor names with
  a confirm-and-create-anyway dialog.
- **Setup wizard** collects operator name + email + company name + email
  + password (was password-only).
- **Branded headers** on PDF/CSV exports (SlowBooks Pro 2026 wordmark +
  company logo).

### Changed
- AI provider config moved from a modal to a Settings sub-page with a
  curated model dropdown and Custom escape hatch.
- Items form gained the full inventory toolset (track checkbox, qty,
  reorder point, asset account).
- Customers/Vendors gained the duplicate-warning confirm dialog.

### Security
- **Single-user authentication** — Argon2id-hashed password, session
  cookie (`same_site=strict`, 30-day TTL).
- **Rate limiting** — slowapi at 5 logins/minute per IP.
- **Security headers** — X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options DENY,
  Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy on all responses.
- **CORS lockdown** — explicit origin allowlist, no wildcards.
- **Path traversal protection** — backup and attachment endpoints use
  `Path.is_relative_to()`.
- **Atomic secret writes** — session key uses `mkstemp` + `os.replace()`.
- **Fernet encryption** for AI provider API keys.
- **SSRF protection** — AI provider URLs validated against private IPs
  and metadata endpoints.
- **Constant-time secret compare** in the Cloudflare Worker gateway.
- **Schema-validated AI config payloads.**
- **CSV formula injection protection** — exports neutralize `=`, `+`,
  `-`, `@` cell prefixes.
- **Non-root Docker** — container runs as UID 1000.

### Performance
- Analytics dashboard: 10 SQL queries, ~26 ms engine on 3,000 invoices
  plus 1,500 bills.
- Test suite runs in under 30 seconds with zero network dependencies.

### Fixed
- Dark mode now works on every report subtotal row (missing `--gray-50`
  definition).
- `--text-main` typo fixed.
