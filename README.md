# Slowbooks Pro 2026

**A personal bookkeeping application "decompiled" from the ashes of QuickBooks 2003 Pro.**

Free and open source. Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. No Intuit activation servers required.

**Get started:** `docker compose up` — see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for all install options.

## The Story

I ran QuickBooks 2003 Pro for 14 years for side business invoicing and bookkeeping. Then the hard drive died. Intuit's activation servers have been dead since ~2017, so the software can't be reinstalled. The license I paid for is worthless.

So I built my own replacement. I transferred all my data from the old .QBW file using IIF export/import.

The codebase is annotated with "decompilation" comments referencing `QBW32.EXE` offsets, Btrieve table layouts, and MFC class names — a tribute to the software that served me well for 14 years before its maker decided it should stop working.

**This is a clean-room reimplementation.** No Intuit source code was available or used.

## What's New in v2.0.0 *(May 2026)*

A major release rolling up Phase 9–11 plus a community walkthrough that closed several UI gaps.

**Analytics & AI**
- New analytics dashboard at `#/analytics` — KPI cards, 4 charts (12-month revenue line, expenses doughnut, A/R+A/P stacked bar, 90-day cash forecast), period selector (MTD/QTD/YTD), CSV/PDF export with branded headers (SlowBooks Pro 2026 wordmark + your company logo)
- **AI Insights** one-shot brief (3 observations / 3 risks / 3 recommendations) on demand
- **AI Predefined Analyses** — 11-action curated dropdown across 5 categories, replacing the earlier free-form chat (more reliable across providers)
- **7 AI providers** supported: xAI Grok, Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI, Cloudflare Worker Gateway (self-hosted), Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini — bring-your-own-key, encrypted at rest with Fernet
- **Settings → AI Insights** centralizes provider/model/key config with a curated model dropdown + Custom escape hatch

**Phase 11 — Inventory, Drill-Down, Duplicate Detection, Saved Reports**
- Real perpetual-inventory ledger with weighted-average cost, COGS journal entries, manual adjustments, reorder points
- Items form exposes the full inventory toolset; Adjust modal handles add/remove/set-to-count with cost re-weighting
- P&L and Balance Sheet rows are now click-through — drill into source transactions with running balance and source-doc links
- Fuzzy duplicate detection on customer/vendor names with confirm-and-create-anyway
- Saved Reports — name and one-click rerun favorite report configs

**Auth, security, ops**
- Single-user setup wizard collects operator name + email + company name + email + password (Phase 9.7)
- argon2id password hashing, slowapi rate limiting (5 logins/minute), session cookie auth
- External security audit pass: SSRF guards on Cloudflare account ID + Worker URL, CSV formula injection protection, schema-validated AI config payloads, constant-time secret compare in the Worker
- Dark mode now actually works on every report subtotal row (missing `--gray-50` definition fixed)

**Performance**
- Analytics dashboard: 10 SQL queries, ~26 ms engine on 3000 invoices + 1500 bills
- 119 pytest tests, runs in under 10 seconds, zero network deps

See the [v2.0.0 release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for the full changelog.

### Analytics (Phase 9)
Real-time business intelligence layer that sits on top of the accounting engine. Powered by `AnalyticsEngine` (`app/services/analytics.py`) with 8 aggregation methods and 7 REST endpoints at `/api/analytics/*`. **Fully integrated inline** into the main SPA as a hash-routed page — no separate shell, no full page reload. Click **Analytics** in the sidebar (under Accounting → Reports → Analytics → Tax Reports) to land on `#/analytics`.

**Metrics computed:**
- **Revenue by Customer** — Paid revenue per customer for the selected period, ranked high-to-low
- **12-Month Revenue Trend** — Monthly paid-revenue history with proper calendar-month bucketing
- **Expenses by Category** — Paid-bill expenses grouped by expense account number
- **A/R Aging** — Open invoice balances bucketed Current / 30 / 60 / 90+ days old, using `invoices.balance_due` so partial payments don't double-count. Table is sorted worst-offender first and includes a TOTAL row.
- **A/P Aging** — Open bill balances bucketed Current / 30 / 60 / 90+ days old (same treatment as A/R)
- **DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)** — `(open A/R balance ÷ last-30-day paid revenue) × 30`
- **90-Day Cash Forecast** — 14 weekly cumulative buckets of expected A/R collections vs A/P payments due on-or-before each cutoff. Net column color-coded green/red.
- **Customer Profitability** — Lifetime paid revenue per customer (first pass; COGS attribution on the roadmap)

**Dashboard UI (`#/analytics`, inline SPA page):**
- **4 KPI cards** — Revenue, Expenses, DSO, Margin%
- **Chart.js visualizations** (self-hosted 206 KB UMD bundle at `/static/js/chart.umd.js` — no CDN, LAN-deployable):
  - Revenue trend — 12-month line chart with filled area + hover tooltips
  - Expenses by category — doughnut chart with legend
  - A/R aging — horizontal stacked bar chart (one bar per customer, stacks = current/30/60/90)
  - A/P aging — horizontal stacked bar chart (one bar per vendor)
  - Cash forecast — dual-line (collections vs payments) + net bar chart overlay
- **Detail tables** under every chart with sort-by-total-descending and TOTAL footer rows
- **Period selector** — Dropdown for Month / Quarter / Year to Date; re-fetches dashboard + re-builds all charts instantly
- **Refresh button** — Re-fetch without navigating away
- **Export CSV** — Downloads flat CSV of the current snapshot at `/api/analytics/export.csv?period=...`
- **Export PDF** — Downloads a print-optimized PDF rendered by WeasyPrint (same dep used for invoice PDFs)
- **Theme-aware** — All Chart.js text/grid colors read from `<html data-theme>` so the charts flip with the main SPA theme toggle

**Date-range filtering (all endpoints):**
```
?period=month|quarter|year          (also accepts mtd/qtd/ytd)
?start_date=YYYY-MM-DD&end_date=YYYY-MM-DD    (explicit override)
```
Unknown period names and missing params fall back to month-to-date. Explicit dates take precedence over named periods.

**CSV export:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/export.csv?period=year' -o analytics.csv
```
Flat CSV with columns `(section, key, subkey, value)` covering 9 sections: period, revenue_by_customer, revenue_trend, expenses_by_category, ar_aging, ap_aging, dso, cash_forecast, customer_profit. Drops straight into Excel / Google Sheets / any BI tool.

#### AI Insights (Phase 9.5)
An optional LLM layer sits on top of the analytics snapshot and produces a compact **3 observations / 3 risks / 3 recommendations** executive brief. Nothing is sent until you click the **AI Insights** button — the feature is zero-cost by default.

**Seven providers supported out of the box** (verified April 2026):

| Provider | Wire format | Default model | Free tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| **xAI Grok** | OpenAI-compat | `grok-4-fast` | $25 signup credit |
| **Groq (LPU Cloud)** | OpenAI-compat | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | Generous free tier, no card |
| **Cloudflare Workers AI** | OpenAI-compat | `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` | 10k neurons/day, no card |
| **Cloudflare Worker Gateway** (self-hosted) | OpenAI-compat | `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` | Same 10k neurons/day — **your keys stay in *your* Cloudflare account** |
| **Anthropic Claude** | `/v1/messages` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Paid only |
| **OpenAI** | `/v1/chat/completions` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Paid only |
| **Google Gemini** | `generateContent` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Free Flash tier via AI Studio |

Each provider's model string is configurable from **Settings → AI Insights** — a curated dropdown per provider with a **Custom…** escape hatch for new model IDs the vendors ship between releases. So renames ("gemini-2.5-flash" → "gemini-3.0-nano") are a Custom-field entry, not a code change. Cloudflare gets an extra field for your account ID since its endpoint is account-scoped. The dedicated **Cloudflare Worker Gateway** provider adds a second field for your Worker URL — see the self-hosted gateway section below.

![AI Insights provider configuration](screenshots/ai-insights-settings.png)

> **Verified providers as of v2.0.0:** Only **Groq** has been validated end-to-end against a live key (both the AI Insights button and the predefined-analysis dropdown). The other six providers' wire formats are implemented and unit-tested but have not been exercised against live credentials. **Accepting working PRs that confirm or fix any provider's config** — open an issue or PR with provider name, working model ID, and any quirks discovered (e.g., headers, payload shape, error mapping).

**Settings encryption.** API keys are stored in the `settings` table under `ai_api_key`, encrypted with **Fernet** (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) via `app/services/crypto.py`. Ciphertext rows carry the prefix `fernet:v1:` so legacy plaintext rows are detected and migrated gracefully. The master key is resolved in priority order:

1. `SETTINGS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (ops-preferred)
2. `.slowbooks-master.key` file next to the repo (zero-config default; auto-created at 0600)
3. Fresh generation on first run (logged as a warning)

**Never commit `.slowbooks-master.key`** — it is in `.gitignore`. Losing it means losing every encrypted secret.

`GET /api/analytics/ai-config` returns `{provider, model, cloudflare_account_id, worker_url, has_api_key, api_key_encrypted, providers}` — the raw key is **never** in the response body. `PUT /api/analytics/ai-config` accepts a Pydantic `AIConfigUpdate` model — `{provider, model, cloudflare_account_id, worker_url, api_key}` — so malformed payloads are rejected with a 422 before they reach the service layer. An empty/missing `api_key` is interpreted as "keep the existing encrypted value", so re-saving the provider won't clobber the stored key.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/analytics/ai-config` — read display config (no secrets)
- `PUT  /api/analytics/ai-config` — update provider/model/key/account_id (key is encrypted on save)
- `POST /api/analytics/ai-config/test` — one-word smoke test against the configured provider
- `POST /api/analytics/ai-insights?period=month|quarter|year[&force=true]` — run the full dashboard analysis; results are cached in-process for 10 minutes per `(provider, model, period)`, unless `force=true`

All calls go through a **hardened** `httpx.Client` with a 60-second timeout, `verify=True` (TLS cert validation), `follow_redirects=False` (no sneaky 302-to-metadata tricks), and a minimal `User-Agent`. Error messages redact the API key before raising, so logs and 502 responses never leak your secret.

**Security hardening (April 2026 external audit pass):**
- **SSRF guard #1** — Cloudflare account IDs must match `^[a-f0-9]{32}$` (regex enforced both at request-build time and in `PUT /ai-config`)
- **SSRF guard #2** — `validate_worker_url()` in `app/services/ai_service.py` rejects plain `http://`, embedded credentials, localhost, `127.0.0.1`, all RFC1918 private ranges, link-local (`169.254.x.x` including the AWS metadata endpoint), multicast, and reserved blocks. URLs are capped at 2048 chars
- **MITM protection** — `verify=True`, `follow_redirects=False`, HTTPS-only enforcement on the Worker URL
- **CSV formula injection** — `_csv_safe()` in `export_csv()` prefixes any user-controlled cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, or `\r` with a leading apostrophe before writing to CSV, neutralizing Excel/Sheets formula execution
- **Request schema validation** — `PUT /ai-config` uses a Pydantic `AIConfigUpdate` model instead of a raw `dict`, so malformed payloads are rejected with a 422 before they reach the service layer
- **Constant-time secret compare** — the shared-secret auth in `cloudflare/worker.js` uses a byte-wise constant-time compare instead of `===`, closing timing side-channels

#### Self-hosted Cloudflare Worker Gateway (per-LAN-owner)

For installations where you don't want **any** AI credentials stored inside Slowbooks (even encrypted), the `cloudflare/` directory ships a minimal Worker that you deploy to **your own** Cloudflare account. Slowbooks only ever holds a shared secret scoped to your one Worker, so dumping the SQLite file doesn't expose enough to talk to Workers AI as you.

**What it buys you:**
- **Your keys never touch Slowbooks' DB.** Workers AI is accessed via the `env.AI.run()` binding — no Cloudflare API token is stored anywhere, in Slowbooks or in the Worker source
- **Per-installation isolation.** Every LAN owner installs their own Worker in their own Cloudflare account. One compromised install can't reach another; one abused install can't burn someone else's quota
- **Free tier friendly.** Cloudflare gives every account 10,000 neurons/day for free — plenty for hundreds of AI Insights runs and tool-calling Q&A sessions
- **Bearer-token auth.** Slowbooks sends `Authorization: Bearer <shared-secret>`; the Worker compares it against `env.AUTH_TOKEN` in constant time and rejects anything else with a 401
- **OpenAI wire format.** The Worker translates Workers AI's native response into OpenAI-shaped JSON (including `tool_calls`) so Slowbooks' existing OpenAI-compat code path works unchanged

**5-minute setup:** `wrangler login` → `openssl rand -hex 32` → `wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN` → `wrangler deploy` → paste the Worker URL + shared secret into Slowbooks **⚙ AI** → Provider: **Cloudflare Worker Gateway (self-hosted)**. Full step-by-step in **[cloudflare/README.md](cloudflare/README.md)**.

**What it does *not* protect against:** a compromised Slowbooks install still has the shared secret, so it can still invoke *your* Worker — rotate the secret if you suspect compromise; abnormal Worker traffic shows up in the Cloudflare dashboard immediately.

#### AI Predefined Analyses

Beyond the headline insights brief, the analytics page exposes a **curated dropdown of 11 predefined analyses** spanning the full ledger surface. Each action pre-fetches its data server-side via the existing `app/services/ai_tools.py` helpers and sends a focused **one-shot** prompt to the LLM (no tool calling, no multi-turn). This avoids the brittle "model emits legacy `<function=...>` syntax" path that some Llama-on-Groq combos still hit, so it works reliably across every provider.

![Analytics with AI predefined analysis output](screenshots/analytics-dashboard.png)

**Categories and actions** (registered in `app/services/ai_actions.py`):

| Category | Action | Tool used |
|---|---|---|
| **Customers & Sales** | Top customers by revenue | `get_sales_by_customer` |
| | Unpaid invoices summary | `search_invoices` |
| | A/R aging | `get_aging_report` |
| **Vendors & Bills** | Expenses by category | `get_expenses_by_category` |
| | Unpaid bills summary | `search_bills` |
| | A/P aging | `get_aging_report` |
| **Banking & Cash** | Cash position by account | `list_accounts` + `get_account_balance` |
| | Recent payment activity | `search_payments` |
| **Financial Reports** | P&L analysis | `get_pl_summary` |
| | Balance sheet analysis | `get_balance_sheet` |
| **Tax** | Sales tax position | `get_tax_summary` |

The page-level period selector (MTD / QTD / YTD) flows through to date-bounded actions automatically; "as of today" actions ignore it. Adding a new action is a single `ActionSpec` registration — point it at one of the existing tool functions and define a one-line framing prompt.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/analytics/ai-actions` — list catalogue grouped by category
- `POST /api/analytics/ai-actions/{key}?period=…` — run one analysis; returns `{action_key, label, category, analysis, data, provider, model, period}`

The 16 underlying read-only tool functions in `ai_tools.py` are still available (and unit-tested) for any future code path that wants tool calling. The **`POST /api/analytics/ai-query`** endpoint that drove the legacy chat panel is retained as a power-user API but is no longer wired into the UI.

**Test coverage:** 119 pytest tests cover AI security, analytics, auth flow, CORS, CSV safety, attachments, IIF import, invoice posting/editing, reporting, rate limiting, inventory posting (COGS, weighted-avg cost, voids), drill-down queries, duplicate detection, and saved reports — all running in under 10 seconds with zero network dependencies.

**PDF export:**
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/export.pdf?period=year' -o analytics.pdf
```
Print-ready PDF via WeasyPrint + Jinja2 (`app/templates/analytics_pdf.html` → `app/services/pdf_service.py::generate_analytics_pdf`). Same template handles all periods. Output: letter-size, page numbers in footer, KPI strip + every table the UI shows. ~18 KB typical for a small business; renders in WeasyPrint in well under a second.

**Performance:** `GET /api/analytics/dashboard` issues exactly **10 SQL queries** regardless of dataset size — every method is single-query (or at most two) with no N+1 relationship loads. Measured on SQLite with 3,000 invoices + 1,500 bills: **~26 ms** engine / ~40 ms full HTTP round-trip; with 8,000 invoices + 4,000 bills: **~50 ms**. The `period` parameter adds zero extra queries. PDF export renders end-to-end in ~100 ms on the medium dataset.

**Tested** with 25-assertion backend regression + 42-assertion headless UI smoke test that loads the real Chart.js UMD bundle in a `vm` context and confirms all 5 chart instances initialize with the expected dataset shapes (1 line chart with 12 points, 1 doughnut with N slices, 2 stacked bars with 4 datasets each, 1 combo chart with 3 datasets).

Quick smoke test once the app is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/dashboard
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/dashboard?period=year
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/export.csv > snapshot.csv
curl http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/export.pdf > snapshot.pdf
```

### Online Payments
- **Stripe Checkout** — Accept online payments via Stripe's hosted checkout page. Customers click "Pay Online" in emailed invoices, pay on Stripe, and the payment auto-records with journal entries (DR Undeposited Funds, CR A/R)

- **Copy Payment Link** — One-click copy of the public payment URL from the invoice view modal
- **Webhook Handler** — Idempotent Stripe webhook processes `checkout.session.completed` events with signature verification
- **Setup Guide** — See **[SETUP_STRIPE.md](SETUP_STRIPE.md)**

### QuickBooks Online Integration
- **OAuth 2.0** — Connect to QuickBooks Online via Intuit's OAuth Authorization Code flow with automatic token refresh
- **Import from QBO** — Pull accounts, customers, vendors, items, invoices, and payments from QBO with dependency-ordered import and duplicate detection

- **Print-Optimized PDF** — Enhanced invoice PDF template with company logo support
- **IIF Import/Export** — Full QuickBooks 2003 Pro interoperability (see below)

### Inventory, Drill-Down & Duplicate Detection (Phase 11)

![Inventory tracking on the item form](screenshots/inventory-tracking.png)

- **Real inventory tracking** — Items can be marked `track_inventory=True` to hit a perpetual-inventory ledger. Every purchase (bill) and sale (invoice) writes a row to `inventory_movements` and updates `quantity_on_hand` + weighted-average `avg_cost`
- **Automatic COGS journal entries** — Selling an inventory item posts `DR COGS / CR Inventory Asset` at the current weighted-avg cost. Voids reverse the entry
- **Weighted-average cost** — Standard perpetual-inventory model: `new_avg = (old_qty × old_avg + received_qty × received_cost) / (old_qty + received_qty)`
- **Reorder points + low-stock report** — `GET /api/items/low-stock` returns items at or below their reorder point, worst-shortage first
- **Inventory valuation** — `GET /api/items/valuation` sums `qty × avg_cost` across all tracked items
- **Manual adjustments** — `POST /api/items/{id}/adjust` for count corrections, shrinkage, spoilage with an offsetting JE to #5900 (Inventory Adjustments) or COGS
- **Drill-down reporting** — `GET /api/reports/account-transactions?account_id=X` returns every journal entry hitting an account in the date range, with source-doc links (`/#/invoices/42`, `/#/bills/17`, etc.) so the SPA can jump from a P&L row to the underlying transaction
- **Fuzzy duplicate detection** — Customer/vendor creation warns with 409 on similar names (difflib similarity ≥ 0.85 after normalizing case, punctuation, and business suffixes like "Inc", "LLC", "Corp"). The form shows a confirm-and-create-anyway dialog with the matched names + similarity %; pass `?force=true` to override programmatically, or use `GET /api/customers/check-duplicate?name=...` for a pre-submit preview

![Duplicate detection warning](screenshots/duplicate-detection.png)
- **Saved reports** — Full CRUD on named `(report_type, parameters)` tuples at `/api/saved-reports`. Lets users one-click rerun their favorite P&L, Balance Sheet, or account drill-down without re-entering dates

### Security & Authentication (Phase 9.7)
- **Single-user authentication** — Password-protected access with setup wizard on first run. Session-based auth with secure cookie (`strict` SameSite, 30-day TTL)
- **Security headers** — X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options (DENY), Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy on all responses
- **CORS lockdown** — No wildcard origins; defaults to localhost, configurable via `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` env var
- **Rate limiting** — Configurable via slowapi; disabled in tests, toggle via `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`
- **Path traversal protection** — Backup download/restore and attachment uploads validated with `is_relative_to()`
- **Sensitive key filtering** — Password hashes and session secrets never returned from the settings API
- **Atomic secret writes** — Session key and encryption master key use `mkstemp` + `os.replace` to prevent race conditions
- **Encrypted API keys** — AI provider keys encrypted at rest with Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
- **Non-root Docker** — Container runs as `slowbooks` user (UID 1000), not root
- **Pinned dependencies** — All `requirements.txt` entries have upper-bound version caps

### System & Administration
- **Dark Mode** — Toggle between QB2003 Blue theme and dark mode (Alt+D or toolbar button). Persists in localStorage
- **Backup/Restore** — Create and download PostgreSQL backups from the settings page
- **Multi-Company** — Support for multiple company databases, switchable from UI
- **Global Search** — Unified server-side search across customers, vendors, items, invoices, estimates, and payments
- **Attachments** — Upload files (PDF, images) to invoices, bills, and other entities with MIME type and extension validation
- **Bank Rules** — Auto-categorize imported bank transactions with pattern-matching rules
- **Budgets** — Create and track budgets by account and period with actual-vs-budget comparison
- **Email Templates** — Customizable email templates for invoices, estimates, and statements

### UI
- Authentic QB2003 "Default Blue" skin with navy/gold color palette (+ dark mode)
- Splash screen with build info and decompilation provenance
- Windows XP-era toolbar, sidebar navigator with icons, status bar
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Alt+N` (new invoice), `Alt+P` (payment), `Alt+Q` (quick entry), `Alt+H` (home), `Alt+D` (dark mode), `Ctrl+S` (save modal form), `Ctrl+K` (search), `Escape` (close modal)
- No frameworks — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS single-page app
- 35+ SPA routes, 34 sidebar nav links

### QuickBooks 2003 Pro Interoperability
- **IIF Export** — Export all Slowbooks data (accounts, customers, vendors, items, invoices, payments, estimates) as .iif files importable into QB2003 via File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files
- **IIF Import** — Parse and import .iif files exported from QB2003 with duplicate detection and per-row error handling
- **Validation** — Pre-flight validation of .iif files before import (checks structure, account types, balanced transactions)
- **Date Range Filtering** — Export invoices and payments for specific date ranges
- **Round-Trip Safe** — Export from Slowbooks, re-import into Slowbooks — deduplication prevents double-entry

### Utilities
- **Backup Script** — `scripts/backup.sh` — pg_dump with gzip compression, keeps last 30 backups
- **Recurring Invoice Cron** — `scripts/run_recurring.py` — Standalone script for generating due recurring invoices
- **IRS Mock Data** — `scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py` — Seeds realistic test data from IRS Publication 583 (Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop: 8 customers, 13 vendors, 10 invoices, 5 payments, 3 estimates)

## Quick Start

### Docker (Windows, macOS, Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
docker compose up
```

Open **http://localhost:3001**. That's it — PostgreSQL, migrations, and seed data are handled automatically.

### Native Install (Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VonHoltenCodes/SlowBooks-Pro-2026.git
cd SlowBooks-Pro-2026
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create database
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER bookkeeper WITH PASSWORD 'bookkeeper'"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE bookkeeper OWNER bookkeeper"

cp .env.example .env
alembic upgrade head
python3 scripts/seed_database.py
python3 run.py
```

Open **http://localhost:3001**.

See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for detailed instructions, macOS native install, demo data, and troubleshooting.

### Backup

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
# Backs up to ~/bookkeeper-backups/ with gzip compression
# Keeps the 30 most recent backups
```

## QuickBooks 2003 Pro — IIF Interoperability

Slowbooks can exchange data with QuickBooks 2003 Pro via **Intuit Interchange Format (IIF)** — a tab-delimited text format that QB2003 uses for file-based import/export.

![QuickBooks Interop Page](screenshots/iif-interop.png)

### Exporting from Slowbooks to QB2003

1. Navigate to **QuickBooks Interop** in the sidebar
2. Click **Export All Data** (or export individual sections)
3. For invoices/payments, optionally set a date range
4. Save the `.iif` file
5. In QuickBooks 2003: **File > Utilities > Import > IIF Files** and select the file

**What gets exported:**

| Section | IIF Header | Fields |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Chart of Accounts | `!ACCNT` | Name, type (BANK/AR/AP/INC/EXP/EQUITY/COGS/etc.), number, description |
| Customers | `!CUST` | Name, company, address, phone, email, terms, tax ID |
| Vendors | `!VEND` | Name, address, phone, email, terms, tax ID |
| Items | `!INVITEM` | Name, type (SERV/PART/OTHC), description, rate, income account |
| Invoices | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, line items, amounts, tax, terms |
| Payments | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, amount, deposit account, invoice allocation |
| Estimates | `!TRNS/!SPL` | Customer, date, line items (non-posting) |

### Importing from QB2003 to Slowbooks

1. In QuickBooks 2003: **File > Utilities > Export > Lists to IIF Files**
2. In Slowbooks: navigate to **QuickBooks Interop**
3. Drag and drop the `.iif` file (or click to browse)
4. Click **Validate** — checks structure, account types, and balanced transactions
5. If validation passes, click **Import**

The importer handles:
- Automatic account type mapping (QB's 14 types → Slowbooks' 6 types)
- Parent:Child colon-separated account names
- Duplicate detection (skips records that already exist by name or document number)
- Per-row error collection (a bad row won't abort the entire import)
- Windows-1252 and UTF-8 encoded files

### IIF Format Reference

IIF is tab-delimited with `\r\n` line endings. Header rows start with `!`. Transaction blocks use `TRNS`/`SPL`/`ENDTRNS` grouping. Sign convention: TRNS amount is positive (debit), SPL amounts are negative (credits), and they must sum to zero.

```
!TRNS	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	AMOUNT	DOCNUM
!SPL	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	AMOUNT	DOCNUM
!ENDTRNS
TRNS	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Accounts Receivable	John E. Marks	444.96	2001
SPL	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Service Income	John E. Marks	-438.00	2001
SPL	INVOICE	01/15/2026	Sales Tax Payable	John E. Marks	-6.96	2001
ENDTRNS
```

### Account Type Mapping

| Slowbooks Type | IIF Types (by account number range) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Asset | `BANK` (1000-1099), `AR` (1100), `OCASSET` (1101-1499), `FIXASSET` (1500-1999) |
| Liability | `AP` (2000), `OCLIAB` (2001-2499), `LTLIAB` (2500+) |
| Equity | `EQUITY` |
| Income | `INC` |
| Expense | `EXP` |
| COGS | `COGS` |

### Sample Data

The `scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py` script populates Slowbooks with test data from **IRS Publication 583** (Rev. December 2024) — "Starting a Business and Keeping Records." The sample business is **Henry Brown's Auto Body Shop**, a sole proprietorship with:

- 8 customers (John E. Marks, Patricia Davis, Robert Garcia, Thompson & Sons, etc.)
- 13 vendors from the IRS check disbursements journal (Auto Parts Inc., ABC Auto Paint, Baker's Fender Co., etc.)
- 8 service/material items (Body Repair, Paint & Finish, Dent Removal, Frame Alignment, etc.)
- 10 invoices totaling $3,631.31 with 1.59% sales tax
- 5 payments totaling $1,498.00
- 3 pending estimates
- All with proper double-entry journal entries

```bash
python3 scripts/seed_irs_mock_data.py
```

### v2.0.0 walkthrough patches

The v2.0.0 release pass surfaced several UI gaps where Phase 11 backend was complete but the frontend wasn't wired up. Closed during a live walkthrough with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code):
- Setup wizard collects operator name + email + company info (was password-only)
- AI provider config moved from a modal to a Settings sub-page with curated model dropdown + Custom escape hatch
- Free-form chat panel replaced with 11 predefined AI analyses (more reliable across providers, especially Groq)
- Items form gained the full Phase 11 inventory toolset (track checkbox, qty, reorder point, asset account, Adjust modal)
- Customers/Vendors gained the duplicate-warning confirm dialog
- Reports gained the Saved Reports list + Save button
- P&L and Balance Sheet rows are now click-through to source transactions
- PDF/CSV exports gained branded headers (SlowBooks Pro 2026 wordmark + company logo)
- Several dark-mode CSS fixes (`--text-main` typo, missing `--gray-50` definition)

**Looking for help validating the other 6 AI providers** — only Groq has been confirmed end-to-end against a live key. PRs welcome that confirm or fix xAI Grok, Cloudflare Workers AI, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, or Google Gemini configs.
