# ============================================================================
# Garnishment Service — CCPA wage-garnishment limits and multi-order priority
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Implements the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (Title III) caps on how
# much of an employee's pay may be withheld for garnishment orders, plus the
# priority ordering used when several orders compete for the same paycheck.
#
# Plain dataclasses keep the engine ORM-independent and easy to unit-test:
# callers translate their own models into GarnishmentSpec objects and read back
# GarnishmentResult objects.
#
# DISCLAIMER: These are SIMPLIFIED federal rules. Many states impose stricter
# limits (lower percentage caps, higher protected-earnings floors, different
# priority among order types). Verify against current federal and state law
# before relying on this for actual payroll.
