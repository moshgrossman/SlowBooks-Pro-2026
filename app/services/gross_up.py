# ============================================================================
# Gross-Up Service — net-to-gross ("gross-up") solver
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Given a desired take-home (net) amount, finds the gross pay that produces it.
# The relationship net = f(gross) is monotonically non-decreasing but has no
# closed form (progressive tax brackets, capped contributions, etc.), so the
# gross is found iteratively by bisection.
#
# The solver is deliberately generic: it does NOT import the payroll
# calculator. Callers pass the net-of-gross function as a callable, which keeps
# this module pure and trivial to unit-test.
