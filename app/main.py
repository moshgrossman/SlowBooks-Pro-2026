# ============================================================================
# Slowbooks Pro 2026 — "It's like QuickBooks, but we own the source code"
# Reverse-engineered from Intuit QuickBooks Pro 2003 (Build 12.0.3190)
# Original binary: QBW32.EXE (14,823,424 bytes, PE32 MSVC++ 6.0 SP5)
# Decompilation target: CQBMainApp (WinMain entry point @ 0x00401000)
# ============================================================================
# LEGAL: This is a clean-room reimplementation. No Intuit source code was
# available or used. All knowledge derived from:
#   1. IDA Pro 7.x disassembly of publicly distributed QB2003 trial binary
#   2. Published Intuit SDK documentation (QBFC 5.0, qbXML 4.0)
#   3. 14 years of clicking every menu item as a paying customer
#   4. Pervasive PSQL v8 file format documentation (Btrieve API Guide)
# Intuit's activation servers have been dead since ~2017. The hard drive
# that had our licensed copy died in 2024. We just want to print invoices.
